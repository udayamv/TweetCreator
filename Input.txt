MELMANGALAM: APRIL 18-20, 2017
Jagadgurus at Melmangalam
ARRIVAL & PUBLIC FUNCTION
Sri Mahasannidhanam and Sri Sannidhanam arrived at the Agrahara of Melmangalam in the evening of April 18, 2017 to a reverential welcome. The Ubhaya Jagadgurus first had Darshan of Sri Adi Shankara Bhagavatpada at the Sringeri Shankara Math. Thereafter, the Jagadgurus graced a public function in the premises of the Pathashala of the Vidya Bharati Saanga Veda Paripalana Sabha at Melmangalam.
After Dhuli Pada was performed by Dharmadhikari Venkatasubramanian, the function began with Veda Ghosha and prayer. Swagata Patrikas in Sanskrit and Tamil were then read and submitted to the Jagadgurus. Sri Mahasannidhanam in His Anugraha Bhashanam said that the devotees at Melmangalam are ardent disciples of the Sringeri Jagadguru and praised them for the wonderful maintenance of the Sringeri Shankara Math in the village. Sri Mahasannidhanam also praised them for having set up a Pathashala to ensure that Bhagavatpada’s first dictum – वेदो नित्यमधीयताम् (Study the Vedas daily) – is followed scrupulously and Vedic chants are always heard in the shrine of Bhagavatpada. Sri Mahasannidhanam also observed that the sanctity of the shrine has been maintained ever since He performed the Prathishta Kumbhabhisheka in 1995 and stated that being in the shrine brings about bliss.
Sri Mahasannidhanam then performed the Sharada Chandramoulishwara Pooja in the newly inaugurated dias dedicated on the occasion for the performance of the Pooja.
